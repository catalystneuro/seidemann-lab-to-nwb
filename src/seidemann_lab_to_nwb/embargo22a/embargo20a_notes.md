# Notes concerning the embargo20a conversion

This conversion requieres some further data that is only available in a table structure in matlab (*). 
To circumvent this issue, the events table in the matlab file should be transformed into a csv file and located in 
the same folder that the other input data is.


(*) Currently, common readers of matlab data from python are not able to extract infromation from these structure.
